  2. Install the npm packages and update the project name and description in package.json
   >npm install

   >npm run seed
  5. Start the server and build your client side files to get started  with: npm run start:dev. If you using Windows, you may need to execute npm run start-server and npm run build-watch separately (in their own terminal tabs).
